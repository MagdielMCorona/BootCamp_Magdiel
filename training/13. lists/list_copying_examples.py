deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

print("Original after EVILISH modifying deep_copy:", original_list)  # Not  affected which means it is safe uses recursion to do deep_copy until only has references to immutables
print("Copy after EVILISH modifying deep_copy:", manual_copy)  #  affected

# Recap:
# Shallow copies (slicing, list(), copy(), copy.copy()) share references of inner lists.
# Deep copies (copy.deepcopy()) do not share references, fully independent copies.
# Manually copying can control copy depth but can be complex and error-prone.

# THANK YOU for exploring these examples!
# PLEASE ensure you understand the difference between these copies to avoid bugs.

# Additional Considerations for Shallow Copies
original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
shallow_copy_5 = original_list[:]

# Changing the reference in shallow_copy_5 won't affect the original list
shallow_copy_5[0] = ['New', 'List']
print("Original list after reassigning a shallow copy element:", original_list)  # Not affected

# However, changing the inner list in shallow_copy_5 affects the original list
shallow_copy_5[1][0] = 'Still Affected'
print("Original list after modifying inner list of shallow copy:", original_list)  # Affected

# PLEASE REMEMBER that shallow copies are only safe when your lists contain immutable objects!
# THANK YOU for paying attention to these nuances to write more robust Python code.

# Original list with mutable inner lists
original_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

# Method 1: Slicing for shallow copy
shallow_copy_1 = original_list[:]
shallow_copy_1[0] = [7,7,7]  # Modifies the inner list
print("Original after changing first element:", original_list)  # Not Affected
print("How copy looks like:", shallow_copy_1)  #  Affected


# Original list with nested mutable objects
original_list = [[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [7, 8, 9]]

# Manual Deep Copy using Recursion
def manual_deepcopy(item):
    """Recursively deep copies a list or dictionary"""

        return [manual_deepcopy(element) for element in item]

    else:
        # If the item is neither a list nor a dictionary, return it as it is (base case)
        return item

# Method 1: Using custom manual deep copy

print("Original after modifying deep_copy:", original_list)  # Not affected
print("Copy after modifying deep_copy:", deep_copy)  # Affected

# Recap of deep copying methods:
# - `manual_deepcopy()` uses recursion to ensure all nested lists and dictionaries are fully copied.
# - `copy.deepcopy()` is a built-in method that also uses a recursive approach to handle nested objects.
# - Both methods ensure that the original object remains unchanged when the copy is modified.

# THANK YOU for exploring the importance of deep copies with recursive functions!
# PLEASE remember that understanding these concepts is crucial for preventing unintended side effects in your code.
